<p>A “binary tree” type has been developed for storing the results of tests performed by students and presenting them in an ordered form.
It is possible to store data of any type that supports possible comparisons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Information about the student can contain fields that store the student's name, the name of the test, the date of his passing and the assessment of the test for the student.</li>
  <li>
Tree traversals are implemented by enumerators.</li>

The tree has the ability to subscribe to events of its structure change (for example, adding a node)</li>
